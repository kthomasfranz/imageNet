\title{Creates a visual graph of a given network}
\usage{
baseNet(data, nodes = NULL, layout = "lgl", label, directed = F,
  node_color, node_size, edge_color, edge_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A network object that can be converted to a tidygraph tbl_graph
(acceptable classes include 'data.frame', 'igraph', 'list', 'matrix', and 'network').
See ?tbl_graph for more information about accepted classes of networks.}

\item{nodes}{A data.frame containing information about the nodes in the graph. Default: NULL}

\item{layout}{The type of layout used to plot the network using ggraph. Either a valid string, a function, a matrix,
or a data.frame. See ?ggraph for more information. Default: 'lgl'}

\item{label}{The variable from the nodes table that should be used to label the nodes in
the plotted network. Default: first column of the nodes table}

\item{directed}{Indicates if the constructed graph should be directed. Default: F}

\item{node_color}{The color of the nodes of the network.  Accepted inputs are either a character vector
that notes a specific color (ex."red") or the name of a variable from the nodes table.
Default: "cornflowerblue"}

\item{node_size}{The size of the nodes of the network.  Accepted inputs are either a numeric vector
that notes a specific size (ex. 6) or the name of a variable from the nodes table. Default: 8}

\item{edge_color}{The color of the edges of the network.  Accepted inputs are either a character
vector that notes a specific color (ex."red") or the name of a variable from the edges table.
Default: "slategrey"}

\item{edge_size}{The size/width of the edges of the network.  Accepted inputs are either a numeric
vector that notes a specific size (ex. 0.5) or the name of a variable from the nodes table.
Default: 0.6}
}
\value{
A list (k) containing the network data in the form of a tidygraph (k$data) and a ggmap
object of the plotted network (k$network).
}
\description{
\code{baseNet} helps provide users with clear, concise visualizations of
their standard network graphs so that they can perform an effective analysis of the network.
}
\details{
The \code{baseNet} function converts the user's network into a \code{tidygraph} class
object, returning the both the tidygraph object and plotting the network using \code{ggmap}.  This
allows for the user to futher edit the network object as needed as well as allowing them to
add further modifications to the ggmap plot, such as editing the title.

\examples{
library(igraphdata)
data("karate")
baseNet(karate, label=name, layout="nicely")
